	My name is Kevin Warner, I am a programer that just finished school at Stevens Henager learning programming. 
    I have developed a love for programming and looking to start a career in computer programming. The purpose of this web 
    site is to so my skills in programming and practise and refine those skills. Will also plan on having several blogs 
    about me and my interests in technology and programming.  I am very excited to create in programming and have some ideas 
    of programs I would like to create it is hard to just settle down and work on one and finish it. I am also an artist and 
    love to create art work also. On this site I will have a digital art gallery to display and share my works of art. Also 
    I will hopfull have some games that i have created as well on this web site. I am glad you came to look at my site and
